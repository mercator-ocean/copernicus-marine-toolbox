Command ``login``
==================

The ``login`` command creates a configuration file called ``.copernicusmarine-credentials`` that grants access to all Copernicus Marine Data Store services. By default, this file is saved in the user's home directory.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: bash

    > copernicusmarine login
    username : johndoe
    password :
    INFO - Configuration files stored in /Users/foo/.copernicusmarine

If the ``.copernicusmarine-credentials`` file already exists, the system will ask for confirmation before overwriting it. You can also use option ``â€“-overwrite`` or ``--overwrite-configuration-file`` to skip confirmation.

You can also use the ``--skip-if-user-logged-in`` option to prevent overwriting the configuration file if the user is already logged in.

Access points migration and evolution
-------------------------------------

If you still have configurations for legacy services (for example, files like ``~/motuclient/motuclient-python.ini``, ``~/.netrc``, or ``~/_netrc`` in your home directory), these will automatically be recognized by the ``get`` and ``subset`` commands without needing to run the ``login`` command.

If your configuration files are stored in a different directory, you can point to them by using the ``--credentials-file`` option when running the ``get`` or ``subset`` commands.
