       "   'description': '**DEFINITION**\\n\\nThe ocean monitoring indicator on regional mean sea level is derived from the DUACS delayed-time (DT-2021 version, “my” (multi-year) dataset used when available, “myint” (multi-year interim) used after) sea level anomaly maps from satellite altimetry based on a stable number of altimeters (two) in the satellite constellation. These products are distributed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service and the Copernicus Marine Service (SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_CLIMATE_L4_MY_008_057).\\nThe time series of area averaged anomalies correspond to the area average of the maps in the Irish-Biscay-Iberian (IBI) Sea weighted by the cosine of the latitude (to consider the changing area in each grid with latitude) and by the proportion of ocean in each grid (to consider the coastal areas). The time series are corrected from global TOPEX-A instrumental drift (WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018) and regional mean GIA correction (weighted GIA mean of a 27 ensemble model following Spada et Melini, 2019). The time series are adjusted for seasonal annual and semi-annual signals and low-pass filtered at 6 months. Then, the trends/accelerations are estimated on the time series using ordinary least square fit.The trend uncertainty is provided in a 90% confidence interval. It is calculated as the weighted mean uncertainties in the region from Prandi et al., 2021. This estimate only considers errors related to the altimeter observation system (i.e., orbit determination errors, geophysical correction errors and inter-mission bias correction errors). The presence of the interannual signal can strongly influence the trend estimation considering to the altimeter period considered (Wang et al., 2021; Cazenave et al., 2014). The uncertainty linked to this effect is not considered.\\n\\n**CONTEXT  **\\n\\nChange in mean sea level is an essential indicator of our evolving climate, as it reflects both the thermal expansion of the ocean in response to its warming and the increase in ocean mass due to the melting of ice sheets and glaciers (WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018). At regional scale, sea level does not change homogenously. It is influenced by various other processes, with different spatial and temporal scales, such as local ocean dynamic, atmospheric forcing, Earth gravity and vertical land motion changes (IPCC WGI, 2021). The adverse effects of floods, storms and tropical cyclones, and the resulting losses and damage, have increased as a result of rising sea levels, increasing people and infrastructure vulnerability and food security risks, particularly in low-lying areas and island states (IPCC, 2022a). Adaptation and mitigation measures such as the restoration of mangroves and coastal wetlands, reduce the risks from sea level rise (IPCC, 2022b). \\nIn IBI region, the RMSL trend is modulated by decadal variations. As observed over the global ocean, the main actors of the long-term RMSL trend are associated with anthropogenic global/regional warming. Decadal variability is mainly linked to the strengthening or weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) (e.g. Chafik et al., 2019). The latest is driven by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)  for decadal (20-30y) timescales (e.g. Delworth and Zeng, 2016). Along the European coast, the NAO also influences the along-slope winds dynamic which in return significantly contributes to the local sea level variability observed (Chafik et al., 2019).\\n\\n**KEY FINDINGS**\\n\\nOver the [1993/01/01, 2023/07/06] period, the area-averaged sea level in the IBI area rises at a rate of 4.00 \\uf0b1 0.80 mm/year with an acceleration of 0.14 \\uf0b1\\uf0200.06 mm/year2. This trend estimation is based on the altimeter measurements corrected from the Topex-A drift at the beginning of the time series (Legeais et al., 2020) and global GIA correction (Spada et Melini, 2019) to consider the ongoing movement of land. \\n\\n**DOI (product):** \\nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00252\\n\\n**References:**\\n\\n* Cazenave, A., Dieng, H.-B., Meyssignac, B., von Schuckmann, K., Decharme, B., and Berthier, E.: The rate of sea-level rise, Nat.

       "   'description': '**DEFINITION**\\n\\nThe OMI_EXTREME_SL_IBI_slev_mean_and_anomaly_obs indicator is based on the computation of the 99th and the 1st percentiles from in situ data (observations). It is computed for the variable sea level measured by tide gauges along the coast. The use of percentiles instead of annual maximum and minimum values, makes this extremes study less affected by individual data measurement errors. The annual percentiles referred to annual mean sea level are temporally averaged and their spatial evolution is displayed in the dataset ibi_omi_sl_extreme_var_slev_mean_and_anomaly_obs, jointly with the anomaly in the target year. This study of extreme variability was first applied to sea level variable (Pérez Gómez et al 2016) and then extended to other essential variables, sea surface temperature and significant wave height (Pérez Gómez et al 2018).\\n\\n**CONTEXT**\\nSea level (SLEV) is one of the Essential Ocean Variables most affected by climate change. Global mean sea level rise has accelerated since the 1990’s (Abram et al., 2019, Legeais et al., 2020), due to the increase of ocean temperature and mass volume caused by land ice melting (WCRP, 2018). Basin scale oceanographic and meteorological features lead to regional variations of this trend that combined with changes in the frequency and intensity of storms could also rise extreme sea levels up to one metre by the end of the century (Vousdoukas et al., 2020). This will significantly increase coastal vulnerability to storms, with important consequences on the extent of flooding events, coastal erosion and damage to infrastructures caused by waves.\\nThe Iberian Biscay Ireland region shows positive sea level trend modulated by decadal-to-multidecadal variations driven by ocean dynamics and superposed to the long-term trend (Chafik et al., 2019).\\n\\n** KEY FINDINGS**\\nThe completeness index criteria is fulfilled by 55 stations in 2021, three more than those  available in 2020 (52), recently added to the multi-year product  INSITU_GLO_PHY_SSH_DISCRETE_MY_013_053. The mean 99th percentiles reflect the great tide spatial variability around the UK and the north of France. Minimum values are observed in the Irish coast (e.g.: 0.66 m above mean sea level in Arklow Harbour), South of England (e.g.: 0.70 m above mean sea level in Bournemouth), and the Canary Islands (e.g.: 0.96 m above mean sea level in Hierro). Maximum values are observed in the Bristol and English Channels (e.g.: 6.26 m and 5.17 m above mean sea level in Newport and St. Helier, respectively). The standard deviation reflects the south-north increase of storminess, ranging between 2 cm in the Canary Islands to 12 cm in Newport (Bristol Channel). Negative or close to zero anomalies of 2021 99th percentile are observed this year for most of the stations in the region, reaching up to -17.8 cm  in Newport, or -15 cm in St.Helier (Jersey Island, Channel Islands).\\n\\n**DOI (product):** \\nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00253\\n\\n**References:**\\n\\n* Abram, N., Gattuso, J.-P., Prakash, A., Cheng, L., Chidichimo, M.
