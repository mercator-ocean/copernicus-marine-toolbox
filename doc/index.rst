Copernicus Marine Toolbox documentation
=======================================

The ``copernicusmarine`` Python library offers capabilities through both **command line interface (CLI)** and **Python API**:

- **Metadata Information**: List and retrieve metadata information on all variables, datasets and products.
- **Subset Datasets**: Subset datasets to extract only the parts of interest, in preferred format, such as Analysis-Ready Cloud-Optimized (ARCO) Zarr or NetCDF file format.
- **Advanced Filters**: Apply simple or advanced filters to get multiple files, in original formats like NetCDF/GeoTIFF, via direct Marine Data Store connections.
- **No Quotas**: Enjoy no quotas, neither on volume size nor bandwidth.
