* Drop support for Python 3.9. The minimum required Python version is now 3.10. Consequently, updated the versions of the dependencies: see the :ref:`dependencies section <installation-page-dependencies>` for more details.

Subset
------

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Added support for subsetting in CSV format even dense datasets.

Fixes
^^^^^^^

* Fixed an issue where download would fail for sparse datasets when some platform metadata was missing. Now, the Toolbox handles missing metadata more gracefully and replace the missing data with ``None``.
* Fixed an issue where an empty file would be created even if there were no data to download for sparse datasets. Now, no file is created.
