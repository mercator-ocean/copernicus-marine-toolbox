New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Drop support for Python 3.9. The minimum required Python version is now 3.10. Consequently, updated the versions of the dependencies: see the :ref:`dependencies section <installation-page-dependencies>` for more details.
* Added widget to contact the User Support directly from the Copernicus Marine Toolbox documentation.

Subset
------

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Added support for subsetting in CSV format even for dense datasets. Also added :ref:`documentation about file formats <file-format>`.
* Progress bars are not displaying Dask tasks numbers which makes them easier to understand.

Fixes
^^^^^^^

* Fixed an issue where download would fail for sparse datasets when some platform metadata was missing. Now, the Toolbox handles missing metadata more gracefully and replace the missing data with ``None``.
* Fixed an issue where an empty file would be created even if there were no data to download for sparse datasets. Now, no file is created.
