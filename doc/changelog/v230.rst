Release 2.3.0
====================

This release introduces some new features and improvements.

General
--------

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Increased the resilience when parsing or fetching the metadata. Make the ``describe`` more robust and consequently the ``subset`` and ``get`` commands as well.
* Improved the documentation page "Polygons Extractor Using the Copernicus Marine Toolbox" in the "Usage and technical details section". It should be clearer and should use less dependencies. See :ref:`"Polygons-based data selection" <polygons-based-data-selection>`.

Subset
------

Fixes
^^^^^

* Fixed an issue where the ``valid_range`` attribute for some variables of some netcdf files was not in the correct format and hence not CF-compliant. The Toolbox now checks the format of the ``valid_range`` attribute and converts it to the same type as the data.

Describe
----------

New-Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Add a flag :ref:`this section <raise_on_error>` to the `describe` command to raise an error when the fetching or parsing fails. Default is set to ``False``.
