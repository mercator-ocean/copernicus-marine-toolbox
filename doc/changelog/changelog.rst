Changelog
============================

The Copernicus Marine Toolbox is under active development. This changelog provides a summary of the changes in each version.

The toolbox follows the `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ scheme.

    Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

    MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
    MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
    PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
    Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
