Release 2.0.0
====================

Changes starting with **B** might introduce breaking changes.

Check the migration guide for information about the breaking changes and the documentation for more information abot the new functionalities.

.. warning::
    One of the important breaking changes is that there is no prompt to confirm the download. Please use ``--dry-run`` if you do not want to download the files.
    The ``--force-download`` option has been removed.

General
''''''''

* Created response types, especially :class:`copernicusmarine.ResponseGet` and :class:`copernicusmarine.ResponseSubset`. A status code has been added to the response.
* Added binaries to be able to use the toolbox. See the :ref:`installation page <installation-page>` for more information.
* ``numpy>=2.0.0`` is supported
* ``python>=3.13`` is now supported
* Created an automatic documentation for the library, with help for the installation, descriptions of the functions and their responses, an example Quick Start Guide, a changelog and migration guide.
* Use the ``h5netcdf`` library to read and write NetCDF files. If you need to save files in NetCDF3 format please just manually install ``netcdf4``.
* Improved the libraries regarding multiprocessing, so users can handle it easier by themselves.
* Improved the output of the command line interface. The output is now more readable and more informative.
* Perfomed some refactoring to improve the conventions of netcdf files.
* Deleted the deprecated options.
* Fixed some of the major bugs, creating a more robust and stable version.

Describe
''''''''''

* Fix a bug where the dataset name was the same for all parts. We put the datasetID in case there are several parts.

Describe command got a lot of new features and changes:

* ``--dataset-id`` and ``--product-id`` are now available making the retrieval of metadata information way faster and optimised.
* **B** Created a documented type for the output of the describe. See :class:`copernicusmarine.CopernicusMarineCatalogue`. The Python interface will return this object directly.
* Added options ``--return-fields`` and ``--exclude-fields`` to filter the fields returned by the describe command in the command line interface.
* **B** "service_type" in the output of the describe command has been removed. The "service_name" is directly displayed in the output.
* **B** ``--include-dataset``, ``--include-keywords``, ``--include-description`` and ``--include-all`` have been removed in favor of the more flexible ``--return-fields`` and ``--exclude-fields``.
* **B** "unit" for coordinates has be renamed to "coordinate_unit" see :class:`copernicusmarine.CopernicusMarineCoordinate`.
* **B** Rename ``--include-versions`` to ``--show-all-versions`` option.
* **B** Deleted the options related to the cache system. So ``--overwrite-metadata-cache``and ``--no-metadata-cache`` have been removed.

Get
'''''

* **B** ``--force-download`` has been removed. Please use the ``--dry-run`` option if you do not want to download the files. See the :ref:`documentation about dry-run option <dry-run>` for more information.
* Included a ResponseGet object as output of the python function.
* Added ``--response-fields`` to filter the fields returned by the get command in the command line interface.
* Add timeout to requests and being able to set the number of retries.
* New ``--skip-existing`` allows you to skip the download of files that already exist at the output destination.
* **B** ``--overwrite-output-data`` has been removed in favor of ``--overwrite``.
* **B** Deleted ``--show-outputnames`` option.
* **B** Deleted the options related to the cache system. So ``--overwrite-metadata-cache``and ``--no-metadata-cache`` have been removed.

Subset
''''''''

* Added ``--response-fields`` to filter the fields returned by the subset command in the command line interface.
* Now it outputs an estimation of the size of the data throughput (the data that will be downloaded) and not only the size of the file.
* Included a ResponseSubset object as output of the python function.
* Rename ``--vertical-dimension-output`` to ``--vertical-axis``.
* **B** Removed ``--subset-method`` option. Some of the functionalities can now be achieved with the new ``--coordinates-selection-method`` option.
* **B** New feature ``--coordinates-selection-method``. The default method maintains the behaviour as before, including some new functionalities.
* Improve dask chunk size handling. The default chunk size is bigger and should be more optimal. Please refer to the :ref:`paragraph about chunk size limit <chunk-size-limit>` for more information.
* **B** Removed the cache system. A new way to access the data has been put in place, more robust and with the same performance.
* **B** Removed the ``--force-download`` option. Please use the ``--dry-run`` option if you do not want to download the files.
* Removed the ``--netcdf-compression-enabled`` option. The compression doesn't need now to be enabled and can be done with the ``--netcdf-compression-level`` option (as before).
* ``--motu-api-request`` has been deprecated. Please contact user support if you need to translate legacy motu requests.
* ``--skip-existing`` allow you to skip the download of files that already exist at the output destination.
* **B** ``--overwrite-output-data`` has been removed in favor of ``--overwrite``.
* **B** ``--force-download`` has been removed. Please use the ``--dry-run`` option if you do not want to download the files. See the :ref:`documentation about dry-run option <dry-run>` for more information.
* **B** Deleted ``--show-outputnames`` option.
* Fixed some bugs with compressing datasets (with option ``--netcdf-compression-level``).
* **B** Deleted the options related to the cache system. So ``--overwrite-metadata-cache`` and ``--no-metadata-cache`` have been removed.

Login
''''''

* Now support the new Copernicus Marine authentication system. The toolbox will try to connect to the new system then fallback to the old one if needed.
* **B** Rename ``--overwrite``, ``--overwrite-configuration-file`` to ``--force-overwrite``.
* **B** Deleted option ``--skip-if-user-logged-in``. We introduced a new option, ``--check-credentials-valid`` for the function that checks if the credentials are valid (so it can be used to prevent login in again).
