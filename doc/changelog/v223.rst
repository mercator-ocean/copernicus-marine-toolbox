Release 2.2.3
==============

Patch that fixes some performance issues and should provide a more consistent behavior.

Fixes
^^^^^

* Fixed a bug where using ``zarr>=3`` would be slower due to blocking operations in a loop. The Toolbox now uses non-blocking operations to improve performance.
* Fixed an issue where we would not raise an error when the requested file format was not supported for sparse datasets. The Toolbox now raises a ``WrongFormatRequested`` exception when the requested format is not supported by the dataset.
* Changed the result of the ``--create-template`` option to have the consistent type with the Command Line Interface.
